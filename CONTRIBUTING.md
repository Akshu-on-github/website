## General Guidelines:
- Be kind
- Be professional
- Not all PRs will be merged quickly as:
  - Further review/modifications may be required
  - Maintainers are volunteers, and may take some time to respond
  - Appeals for PRs marked as Invalid/Spam/Duplicate will take time to review
- Don't raise PRs to issues opened by others without gaining acknowledgment in the relevant issue
- Check if there are any pre-existing Issues or PRs
